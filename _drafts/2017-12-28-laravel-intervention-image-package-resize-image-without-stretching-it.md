title: Laravel and Intervention Image package - Resizing image while keeping aspect ratio
---
it is easy to resize an image if dimension is greater than or equal 200 x 200 pixels. However if image dimension is different such as 500 x 200 or 100 x 150, the result image become stretch or blurry.

is there any way, i can resize the image and keep the aspect ratio and centre it and fill-up rest of the area using transparent color (as i need to keep 200 x 200 dimension)?
